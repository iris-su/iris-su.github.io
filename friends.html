<h1>Friends</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Find good friends who build your daughter up.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid toxic relationships where their friends can be a negative impact on them. If your daughter suddenly starts to act differently, for example, if she starts to wear different  clothes that you don’t approve, thats a sign that something is not right. You should then intervene and communicate your thoughts assertively. Make sure that you and your daughter have a good relationship, so you can effectively interact with her.</li>
            <li>To make sure your daughter is being her best, make sure she has a good friend group who supports her, stands by her, and can confront her when she’s doing something wrong. </li>
        </ul>
    <li>Be a good friend by being selfless, trustworthy and humane.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To be a good friend, your daughter needs to possess some of these qualities. She has to be selfless to an extent, in that she sees other people’s needs before her own, but she also needs to take care of herself too. Your daughter should also be trustworthy, so that people will trust her and want to be around her. Last of all, she should be humane, and understand that people sometimes make mistakes, and that is normal.</li>
            <li>For your daughter to thrive, she needs to be raised up with proper manners and characteristics. </li>
        </ul>
    <li>Allow them to have friends of all kinds.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Many parents get worried that their daughter is friends with people of the opposite gender. It is perfectly normal for girls to be friends with guys and not be dating them.</li>
            <li>It is also good to expose your daughter to people of different ethnicities, this way she can learn more about the world, through her friends. It’s like two in one package!</li>
            <li>Bring her to camps like Girls Who Code, which can expose her to the STEM field and to people of different ethnicities. </li>
        </ul>
</ol>
