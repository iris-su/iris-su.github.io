    <h4>Tips for if your daughter dates</h4>
    <p>A suggestion might be to let your daughter start dating no earlier than 16. Also, if you're daughter is friends with boys, its perfectly normal, don't be afraid. Guys and girls can be friends. If your daughter does have a boyfriend, judge for yourself if this is healthy for her. If she has her priorities in order, such as, she puts school before boys, she is in great shape! Make sure she isn't changing her appearance to impress him. If you don't like the person she wants to or is dating, state your opinion. Although she may not like what you may have to say, don't let that ruin your relationship with your daughter. Talk to her as much as possible so she will open up.</p>

    <h4>What if my daughter is not heterosexual?</h4>
    <p>If your child is queer, donâ€™t freak out. It is perfectly normal. You should accept your child for who they are. Don't tell them that you've always knew or place blame on them, instead tell them how you love them and help them tell others. They should be proud of who they are.</p>
