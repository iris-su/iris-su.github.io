    <h4>What They Are:</h4>
        <p>Periods are a natural, normal body process for all females where they physically mature.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How It Works:</h4>
        <p>Each month, the female reproductive system prepares itself to have a baby, relasing an egg from the ovaries into the uterus where there is "padding" on the walls to protect the egg. When there is no sperm to fertilize the egg, the body sheds the lining and it comes out as blood small clumps of lining. This lasts for about 3-7 days and your daughter will have to wear pads or tampons to contain the menstrual stream.</p>

    <h4>Pads and Tampons:</h4>
        <p>Pads are disposable sanitary napkins that absorb fluids that come out during periods. Tampons have the same purpose as pads. However, instead of laying it out on the underwear, it goes inside the vagina. They are more convenient than pads for activities like sports and swimming. Your daughter just needs to be a little bit more careful with tampons and make sure that when she inserts it, she angles it slightly upwards, aiming for the samll of her back. We suggest starting out with pads when she first gets her period, and then moving on to tampons once she feels comfortable. Also make sure she knows to change her pad or tampon every 6-8 hours or as needed depending on her flow.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How to Help:</h4>
        <p>Your daughter may get cramps, which can hurt a lot. Intense headaches are also common. Ibuprofen usually helps to combat the pain. She was also most likely be craving some kind of food. Try to have whatever she craves at home at all times in case her period catches her by surprise. Girls also have lots of mood swings and are very emotional while on their period. Make sure to be patient and gentle because she might be easily angered due to hormones.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>How to Talk to Them:</h4>
        <p>Although this subject may be very awkward, in the end, you are her father. Periods are a very normal thing, so you only need to talk to her about it a couple of times. Understand how she will act during her periods, so you can act appropriately and try to help her in any way you can.</p>
