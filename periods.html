    <h1>Periods</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>What they are:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Periods are a natural, normal body process for all females to become women and mature physically.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>How it works:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Every month, for 3-7 days, our daughter will have her period. This means she’ll have to wear pads or tampons, to contain their menstrual stream.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Pads vs tampons:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pads are disposable sanitary napkins that absorb the fluids that come out. </li>
                <li>Tampons are also like pads; however, instead of laying it out on the underwear, it goes inside the girl’s body.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your daughter needs to be able to angle it in towards the small of her back, otherwise she might harm herself.</li>
                    <li>A suggestion is to just start with pads, and if they want to use tampons, they can later on. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Your daughter has to change their pad or tampon every 6-8 hours, or else she may get a infection. </li>
            </ul>
        <li>How long it lasts/How to help:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>During this period of time, your daughter will be in distressed. She may get cramps, which will hurt  A LOT.</li>
                <li>She will be emotional, so if she’s craving anything, make sure she gets what she wants. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It might be a good idea to store your house with things she wants to eat.</li>
                    <li>So if she’s on her period and in a bad mood, understand that she’s just on her period. </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <li>How to talk to them:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Although this subject may be very awkward, in the end, you are her father, so it shouldn’t be that bad. Periods are a very normal thing. You only need to talk to her about it a couple of times. Understand how she will act during her periods, and try to help her. </li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
