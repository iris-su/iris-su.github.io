<h3>Tips for dads about communication:</h3>

<ol>
  <li type="1">Female Role Models:</li>
  <ul>
    <li type="a"> Female mentors are really important for your daughter to look up to and talk to. Girls need strong, independent, women to look up to and need a female figure to talk to and ask questions. These can be family friends, aunts, community leaders, grandmothers, etc. </li>
    <li type="a"> Have good healthy relationships with females. </li>
    <li type="a"> Make sure they have good female role models in their life. </li>
  </ul>



  <li type="1">Involvement in Their Life:</li>
    <ul>
Make sure you are involved in your daughter’s life. Do fun activities with them, talk to them, make sure everything is okay, etc.
Family activities: Go shopping with her and go to sporting events.
Work Schedule:
Make sure you have a suitable work schedule that works with your daughter’s schedule, so that you can spend time together and be in her life. You can talk to your boss and look into options like working from home.
Emotions/Interactions:
Make sure you remain calm in front of your child. Don’t lose it in front of your child because even though it’s exhausting, you have to keep it together in front of your child. But showing emotions and being able to express them is important, so find other ways to do that. Have a support team. Have a support network and don’t be afraid to ask for help.
Have fun with your child. Be nurturing and empathetic. You grow and learn as time goes on. Don’t fix things that don’t need fixing.
Make compromises.
Don’t overprotect. Learn to let your child struggle and figure out their own problems. Let them be independent.
Be able to express love in ways she can receive it.
Be upfront and honest. Even though things can be awk.
Home life:
Have a routine and be able to provide. Go grocery shopping, learn to cook and do the chores.
School/Future:
Think about short term and long term.
Plan for future
Ex/Bio Mom?:
Explain to your child in a way that’s appropriate for their age why you’re a single dad and make sure they understand. If divorced, don’t say anything bad about your ex. Make sure to have a schedule, especially if  co-parenting.
Don’t speak badly about your ex.
