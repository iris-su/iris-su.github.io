<h4>Tips for dads about communication:</h4>
    <p>Female mentors are really important for your daughter to look up to and talk to. Girls need strong, independent, women to ask questions to. These females can be family friends, aunts, community leaders, grandmothers, etc.</p>
<br>
<h4>Make time for your daughter.</h4>
    <p>We recommend that you make sure you are involved in your daughter’s life. Do fun activities with her, talk to her, make sure everything is okay, etc. Some good family activities may include going shopping with or going to sporting events. We understand that it may be hard, but do try to make sure you have a suitable work schedule that works with your daughter’s schedule. This is so that you can spend time together and be in her life. You can talk to your boss and look into options like working from home.</p>
<br>
<h4>Express feelings in a healthy way.</h4>
    <p>Make sure you remain calm in front of your daughter. Don’t lose it in front of your her because even though it’s exhausting raising a kid, you have to keep it together. Despite this, showing emotions and being able to express them is important, so find other ways to do that. Be able to express love in ways she can receive it along with trying to be as upfront and honest as you can even though things can be awkward. Have a support team. Form a support network and don’t be afraid to ask for help! No one said raising a girl would be easy. Have fun with your child. Be nurturing and empathetic. You grow and learn as time goes on. Don’t fix things that don’t need fixing. Make compromises and don’t overprotect. You must learn to let your child struggle and figure out their own problems and let them be independent over time.</p>
<br>
<h4>Take up your responsibilities.</h4>
    <p>Have a routine and be able to provide. Go grocery shopping, learn to cook and do the chores. Think about the short term and long term. Plan for the future. If you’re a single dad, explain why to your daughter in an age-appropriate way. If you’re divorced, don’t say anything bad about your ex. Make sure to have a schedule, especially if  co-parenting.</p>
