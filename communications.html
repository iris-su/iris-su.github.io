<h3>Tips for dads about communication:</h3>

<ol>
  <li Female Role Models:
Female mentors are really important for your daughter to look up to and talk to. Girls need strong, independent, women to look up to and need a female figure to talk to and ask questions. These can be family friends, aunts, community leaders, grandmothers, etc. We also suggest that your daughter  have good healthy relationships with females as well as role models.

We recommend that you make sure you are involved in your daughter’s life. Do fun activities with them, talk to them, make sure everything is okay, etc. Some good family activities may include  going shopping with her and going to sporting events.

We do understand that it may be hard but do try to make sure you have a suitable work schedule that works with your daughter’s schedule. This being so that you can spend time together and be in her life. You can talk to your boss and look into options like working from home.

Make sure you remain calm in front of your child. Don’t lose it in front of your child because even though it’s exhausting, you have to keep it together in front of your child. But showing emotions and being able to express them is important, so find other ways to do that. Have a support team. Form  a support network and don’t be afraid to ask for help! No one said raising  child would be easy.

Have fun with your child. Be nurturing and empathetic. You grow and learn as time goes on. Don’t fix things that don’t need fixing.Make compromises and don’t overprotect.You must learn to let your child struggle and figure out their own problems and let them be independent.

Be able to express love in ways she can receive it along with trying to be as upfront and honest as you can be  even though things can be awkward.

Have a routine and be able to provide. Go grocery shopping, learn to cook and do the chores. Think about short term and long term. Plan for future. Explain to your child in a way that’s appropriate for their age why you’re a single dad and make sure they understand. If divorced, don’t say anything bad about your ex. Make sure to have a schedule, especially if  co-parenting.

Summary:
“Create the Optimal Work-Life Balance to Reduce Outside Sources of Stress. Keep Your Calm By. Finding an Outlet for Emotions. Build a Support Structure of Friends and Family. Set Clear Goals for both the Short and Long Term. Commit to Preparation for Future Events. There is no easy path to becoming a successful single parent. It will take hard work and require sacrifices. But millions have been down the path before and come out as successful and well-grounded individuals with strong families.”
