<h1>About Us</h1>
<hr>
<center><img src="GWClogo.png" alt="gwclogo"></center>
<br>
    <p> We are a group of high school students, who are in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at TripAdvisor Boston. Most of us had no experience in computer programming before this program, but we're interested in computer science and the STEM fields. We created this website because we know there are a lot of dads who struggle with taking care of their daughters. This website was mostly designed for single dads, but is also applicable and helpful to gay dads or just any confused dad in general.</p>
